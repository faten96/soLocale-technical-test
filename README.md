# Arithmetic Expression Calculator

This application also includes a Calculator API that evaluates mathematical expressions with nested parentheses and multiple bracket types.

How It Works : 

The calculator is implemented using a variation of the Shunting Yard Algorithm, which ensures:

- Operator precedence is respected (* and / before + and -)
- Nested and mixed brackets are supported () [] {}
- Invalid inputs and division by zero are safely handled
- Efficient computation using internal stacks (Deque)

Example : 
Valid expression 

```
{
  "expression": "{[(1*2+(3/4)/(7*3))]+[5*(6-2)]}"
}
```
Response
```
{
  "result": 20.0143
}
```

Invalid expression 
```
{
  "expression": "5 + (3 / (2 - 2))"
}
```
Response
```
{
  "error": "Math error: Division by zero"
}
```
